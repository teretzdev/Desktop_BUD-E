Use the Picovoice Platform: The recommended approach is to use the Picovoice Platform, which provides access to Porcupine and other Picovoice engines. You'll need to create an account, obtain an access key, and then use their Python SDK (pvporcupine) to access the wake word engine. The access key you already obtained should work, but you'll need to modify the code to use the platform API rather than looking for local .ppn files.
